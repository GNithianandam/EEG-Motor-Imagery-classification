# EEG-Motor-Imagery-classification

This study compares four deep learning models and two data augmentation methods for the classification of Motor Imagery tasks. ShallowConvNet, EEGNet, and DeepConvNet were chosen as deep learning models. In this work, the Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning method is used to address the issue of data scarcity. To augment the existing data, noise addition and a sliding window are used. For the noise addition method, a mean of zero and different standard deviation values are trailed to determine whether the distinctive or similar samples generated from the original data improve classification accuracy. To find the best sliding window method for augmenting Motor Imagery EEG data, augmented data with overlapping windows and non-overlapping windows are tested separately. Transfer learning is implemented using ResNet50, which has been pre-trained on ImageNet. The results of this study demonstrated that augmented data with noise addition significantly improved classification accuracy across all deep learning models. The noise addition method with a standard deviation of 0.02 and a mean of 0 and EEGNet produced the best mean classification accuracy of 81.4% across all tests in our experiment.
